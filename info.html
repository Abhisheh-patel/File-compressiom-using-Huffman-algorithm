    <h2>This tool uses Huffman Coding to compress data! </h2>
    <h1>Huffman Coding:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>It is a popular technique used for <b>Lossless Data Compression</b>.</li>
        <li>
            A Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman.
        </li>
        <li>
            The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.
